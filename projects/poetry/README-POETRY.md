# Poetry Showcase - Setup Guide

A beautiful, vintage-styled single-page application for displaying your poetry collection with automatic .txt file loading and URL-based navigation.

## Features

- ✨ **Automatic Loading**: Converts .txt files into a JSON format
- 🔗 **URL Navigation**: Direct links to specific poems (e.g., `#page-2`)
- 📜 **Vintage Design**: Time-stained parchment aesthetic with Courier New typography
- 📱 **Responsive**: Works beautifully on all devices
- 🎨 **Authentic Effects**: Coffee stains, water marks, fold creases

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Your .txt Files (Recommended)

1. **Organize your poetry files**
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── poetry/
   │   ├── poem-1.txt
   │   ├── poem-2.txt
   │   └── poem-3.txt
   ├── convert-poetry.js
   └── poetry-showcase-dynamic.html
   ```

2. **Format your .txt files** (optional but recommended)
   ```
   Title of Your Poem
   Month Year (e.g., October 2015)
   
   Your poem content here...
   Line by line
   Stanza by stanza
   ```
   
   If you don't include title/date in the file, the script will:
   - Use the filename as the title
   - Set date as "Undated"

3. **Run the conversion script**
   ```bash
   node convert-poetry.js ./poetry
   ```
   
   This creates a `poems.json` file that the HTML page will load.

4. **Place files together**
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── poems.json              (generated by script)
   └── poetry-showcase-dynamic.html
   ```

5. **Open the HTML file** in your browser or host it on a web server.

### Option 2: Manual JSON Creation

If you prefer to create the JSON manually or already have your poems in another format:

1. Create a `poems.json` file with this structure:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "unique-poem-id",
       "title": "Your Poem Title",
       "date": "Month Year",
       "content": "Your poem content\nWith line breaks\nPreserved as \\n",
       "filename": "original-file.txt"
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Place `poems.json` next to `poetry-showcase-dynamic.html`

## URL Navigation

Once set up, you can link directly to specific poems:

- `poetry-showcase-dynamic.html` - Shows first poem
- `poetry-showcase-dynamic.html#page-1` - Shows first poem
- `poetry-showcase-dynamic.html#page-2` - Shows second poem
- `poetry-showcase-dynamic.html#page-3` - Shows third poem
- etc.

This is perfect for:
- Sharing specific poems via URL
- Creating a table of contents with direct links
- Integrating with your main portfolio site

## Integration with BLOT.WORLD

To integrate with your existing site:

1. **Update the back link** in `poetry-showcase-dynamic.html`:
   ```html
   <a href="../../index.html" class="back-link">← Return to BLOT.WORLD</a>
   ```
   Change this path to match your site structure.

2. **Add navigation links** from your main site:
   ```html
   <a href="projects/poetry/poetry.html#page-2">Read "Upon a Dove"</a>
   ```

3. **Update project cards** to link to specific poems:
   ```html
   <a href="projects/poetry/poetry.html#page-1" class="project-card-link">
   ```

## File Structure for Your Site

Recommended structure:
```
your-site/
├── index.html
├── projects/
│   └── poetry/
│       ├── poetry.html (rename from poetry-showcase-dynamic.html)
│       ├── poems.json
│       └── txt-files/ (optional - for reference)
│           ├── poem-1.txt
│           ├── poem-2.txt
│           └── poem-3.txt
├── css/
├── images/
└── js/
```

## Customization

### Colors
Edit the CSS variables in the `<style>` section:
```css
:root {
    --parchment: #f4e8d8;      /* Main background */
    --ink: #2a2418;             /* Text color */
    --accent: #8b4513;          /* Accent color */
}
```

### Typography
Change the fonts by updating the Google Fonts link and CSS:
```css
body {
    font-family: 'Your Font', 'Courier New', monospace;
}
```

### Navigation Style
- Numbered buttons (current): Simple and clean
- Text labels: Change `btn.textContent = poem.title` in JavaScript
- Custom styling: Modify `.nav-btn` CSS class

## Troubleshooting

**"Unable to load poems" error:**
- Ensure `poems.json` is in the same directory as the HTML file
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Verify JSON is valid at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)

**Poems not showing:**
- Check that poems array in JSON is not empty
- Verify JSON structure matches the example
- Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

**Hash navigation not working:**
- Ensure you're using `#page-1`, `#page-2` format (not `#1`, `#2`)
- Page numbers start at 1 (not 0)
- Check that the page number doesn't exceed your poem count

## Technical Details

- **No external dependencies** (except Google Fonts)
- **Pure vanilla JavaScript** - no frameworks required
- **Client-side only** - works with static hosting
- **Mobile-responsive** with touch-friendly navigation
- **SEO-friendly** with proper meta tags and semantic HTML
