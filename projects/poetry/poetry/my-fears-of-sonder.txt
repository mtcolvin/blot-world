My Fears of Sonder
November 2025

Through the dark I ever wander
Just to live--mirage of wonder.
Ticking time, a time to ponder
Plagued by thoughts and fears of sonder.

Like mountains tall looming grand
Standing humble on the land.
Like ants, to me, march in line;
I gaze above, a swath of pine.

We cut through soft pitter-patter.
A gale through flesh does scatter.
We stand abreast as curtain calls
And take a bow as wonder falls.

Into soot
--we pussyfoot.
