Upon a Dove on the Railroad Track
October 2015

A pure, gray dove o'th morning dew,
Through morning air with grace it flew,
Did swoop right down to nature's pew,
A noble action didst Satan rue.

Spitter clack smack on the railroad track,
A nation's toil and lack of sack
Did build a monument so grand
In the pure and golden sand.

Upon this track, a dove did lie,
Oblivious to lies foretold.
Mephistopheles did fie,
and God did mark with purest gold.

The angels beg and plead and shout and pray,
"Evermore, evermore, evermore."
