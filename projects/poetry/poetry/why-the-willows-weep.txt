Why the Willows Weep
December 2025

Like sculpted silt and painted sky
Like brushstroke clouds, Nature's sigh.
A poignant sight of willow's weep,
And to those whose feelings keep
Their tales to tell in expanse
A drop let fall with every glance.

I look to find sequoia's seek
Or scurry with the rabbits meek.
Every cell and stalk will yearn
A reason for an ash-filled urn.
But reason isn't always granted
Inopportune to words seen canted.

--So I ask the why they spend
The time, the time it takes to tend
To tend, to read the fountain prose
That lies beside a stemless rose.

Entre nous,
A fond adieu.
C'est la vie,
So we'll see.
