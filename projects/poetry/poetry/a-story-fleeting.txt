A Story Fleeting
April 2022

Kissed a time, a place, a when;
Only brothers can amend.

Under Thou shall stories told
Rest forever; thought, untold.

Thou, shalt know;
——thou, shalt seek:
Nothing is,
——truly weak.

Eternality,
——itself does die.
Years, it’s felt;
——have gone by.

I love you dearly,
——may we meet
when times are better,
——bittersweet.
