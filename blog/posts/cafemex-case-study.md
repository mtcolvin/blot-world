## Why this exists

Café Mexicali is a place I interact with regularly. It's a Californian-Mexican fusion restaurant that's become a genuine community hub—the kind of place where the staff knows your order and the atmosphere reflects the people who gather there.

But the branding didn't match that energy. The existing logo felt dated, static. It didn't communicate the adaptability and modern spirit of the community it serves. Every time I visited, I saw a disconnect between the vibrant experience inside and the visual identity representing it.

So I redesigned it. Not as a commissioned project, but as an exercise in seeing potential where others might see "good enough." This is what happens when you combine everyday observation with the tools to act on it.

## The goal

Capture the modern landscape. Create a visual identity that communicates adaptability, community, and the fusion of two rich culinary cultures—Californian freshness and Mexican tradition.

The existing branding was functional but forgettable. I wanted something that felt alive, something that could flex across applications while maintaining a strong core identity. A system, not just a logo.

## Design decisions

### Color palette

The colors came from two sources: respect for what existed and honoring the region.

I pulled from their previous logo—not to preserve it exactly, but to maintain visual continuity for existing customers. Then I layered in the colors typically associated with the Southwest: warm terracottas, desert oranges, sun-bleached yellows. The result is a palette that feels both familiar and elevated.

Bold, but not overwhelming. Vibrant enough to stand out, grounded enough to feel authentic.

### Logo and identity

The mark needed to work at any size—from a favicon to a building sign. I designed it in Affinity Designer, focusing on clean geometry and strong negative space. The fusion concept is built into the structure: clean, modern lines meet warm, approachable forms.

The identity system extends beyond the logo. I created vectors and rasters optimized for different contexts, favicons for digital presence, profile pictures for social media, and mockups showing how it lives in the real world. It's a complete package because half-finished branding isn't branding—it's decoration.

### Applications

A logo is only as good as its applications. I mocked up menus, signage, packaging, uniforms—anything that touches a customer. The system had to be flexible enough to work across these contexts while remaining instantly recognizable.

This wasn't just about making things look good. It was about creating something the restaurant could actually use.

## What I learned

Branding for real places you care about hits differently than hypothetical projects. You're not designing for a portfolio; you're designing for people. That changes how you think about every decision.

I learned that honoring what existed while pushing it forward is harder than starting from scratch. It requires restraint and respect—knowing when to preserve and when to break.

I also learned that complete brand systems take time. You can't just make a logo and call it done. The real work is in the details: how it scales, how it adapts, how it lives in someone's hands.

## Closing thoughts

This project reinforced something I already believed: good design is about seeing what could be and having the skills to make it real. Café Mexicali didn't ask for a rebrand. But I saw the gap between what it was and what it could communicate, and I filled it.

Whether they ever use it doesn't matter. What matters is that I documented what I saw, applied what I know, and created something that represents a place I value.

That's what this archive is for—capturing the work that happens when you refuse to accept "good enough."

This was a passion project, done independently. If you're thinking about redesigning something you interact with daily, do it. Not for approval, but because you see the potential and have the tools to act on it.
