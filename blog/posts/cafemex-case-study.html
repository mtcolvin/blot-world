            <!-- Content -->
            <div class="post-content">
                <h2>The Brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Café Mexicali needed more than just a logo—they needed an identity that captured the vibrant intersection of Californian freshness and Mexican tradition. The goal was to create a brand that felt both authentic and modern, appealing to food enthusiasts who appreciate quality ingredients and bold flavors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The challenge: How do you represent two rich culinary cultures without resorting to clichés? How do you make the brand feel fresh and contemporary while honoring traditional roots?
                </p>

                <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>

                <h3>Understanding the Competitive Landscape</h3>
                <p>
                    I began by analyzing successful restaurant brands in both the Mexican and Californian fusion spaces. What I noticed:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Many Mexican restaurants rely on predictable imagery: sombreros, cacti, and heavy serifs</li>
                    <li>California-focused brands tend toward minimalism, often losing personality</li>
                    <li>The sweet spot was unexplored: bold colors with clean, modern execution</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cultural Elements & Symbolism</h3>
                <p>
                    I researched Mexican folk art, particularly <em>papel picado</em> (decorative paper banners) and traditional tile patterns. From California, I drew inspiration from mid-century modern design and the sun-drenched aesthetic of Southern California. The fusion of these elements would become the foundation of the brand.
                </p>

                <div class="callout info">
                    <div class="callout-title">Research Insight</div>
                    <p>The most authentic brands don't copy cultural elements—they reinterpret them through a modern lens. Respect tradition, but make it relevant.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Color Palette Development</h2>

                <p>
                    Color would be the most immediate brand expression. After dozens of iterations, I landed on a palette that balanced warmth and energy:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mexicali Orange (#F04923):</strong> The primary brand color—energetic, appetizing, and impossible to ignore</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunflower Yellow (#F3B41B):</strong> California sunshine, warmth, and optimism</li>
                    <li><strong>Adobe Brown (#89421E):</strong> Earthy grounding, connecting to traditional materials and authenticity</li>
                    <li><strong>Dark Charcoal (#1A1A1A):</strong> Modern sophistication and premium quality</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These colors aren't just decorative—they tell a story. Orange and yellow evoke the warmth of Mexican spices and California sun. Brown grounds the brand in authenticity. Dark charcoal adds the polish and premium feel.
                </p>

                <h2>Logo Design Process</h2>

                <h3>Concept Sketches</h3>
                <p>
                    I explored dozens of concepts, from literal interpretations (the Mexicali border, food imagery) to abstract marks. The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to represent <em>what</em> the restaurant serves and started thinking about <em>how</em> it makes people feel.
                </p>

                <h3>The Final Mark</h3>
                <p>
                    The final logo features a stylized sunburst pattern inspired by traditional Mexican tile work, but executed with clean, geometric precision. The circular form suggests community, gathering, and the completeness of a meal shared.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The wordmark uses a custom-modified sans-serif typeface—clean and legible, but with subtle geometric modifications that echo the iconmark. The accent on the 'é' in 'Café' is emphasized as a design element, celebrating the authenticity of the name.
                </p>

                <h2>Building the Visual System</h2>

                <h3>Typography Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>
                    I established a clear typographic system:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Headlines:</strong> Bold geometric sans-serif for impact and clarity</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Text:</strong> Clean, highly legible sans-serif for menus and descriptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Accent Text:</strong> Condensed variant for labels and tags</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pattern Library</h3>
                <p>
                    Extending the brand beyond the logo, I created a library of patterns inspired by traditional <em>azulejo</em> tiles. These patterns could be used as backgrounds, dividers, or decorative elements across all brand touchpoints—from menus to packaging to social media.
                </p>

                <h3>Iconography</h3>
                <p>
                    A set of custom icons was developed for common restaurant needs: dietary markers (vegetarian, gluten-free, spicy), amenity icons (takeout, delivery, catering), and ingredient callouts. Each icon shares the same geometric language as the logo, maintaining visual cohesion.
                </p>

                <div class="key-takeaways">
                    <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                    <p>Three core principles guided every design decision:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bold but not Busy:</strong> Use color confidently, but give it breathing room</li>
                        <li><strong>Modern but not Cold:</strong> Clean design doesn't have to lack personality</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistent but not Boring:</strong> A flexible system that feels fresh in every application</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Deliverables Package</h2>

                <p>
                    The final brand package included everything needed for a comprehensive rollout:
                </p>

                <h3>Core Assets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logo variations (full color, single color, reversed, icon-only)</li>
                    <li>Color palette with HEX, RGB, and CMYK values</li>
                    <li>Typography specifications and font files</li>
                    <li>Pattern library (8 unique tile patterns)</li>
                    <li>Icon set (24 custom icons)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Application Mockups</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Menu designs (dine-in and takeout)</li>
                    <li>Business card and letterhead</li>
                    <li>Signage concepts (exterior and interior)</li>
                    <li>Packaging design (to-go containers, bags, cups)</li>
                    <li>Social media templates</li>
                    <li>Website homepage mockup</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Brand Guidelines</h3>
                <p>
                    A comprehensive 20-page brand guidelines document detailing proper logo usage, color applications, typography rules, and do's and don'ts. This ensures brand consistency as the restaurant grows and new materials are needed.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Execution</h2>

                <h3>Working in Affinity Designer</h3>
                <p>
                    I chose Affinity Designer for this project for several reasons:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vector Precision:</strong> Logos need to scale infinitely, from business cards to billboards</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Handles complex artboards and mockups without lag</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Flexibility:</strong> Easy export to multiple formats (SVG, PDF, PNG, EPS)</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-subscription Model:</strong> One-time purchase makes it accessible to clients who may need to make minor edits</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>File Organization</h3>
                <p>
                    Proper file organization is critical for brand work. I delivered:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Master design files with organized artboards</li>
                    <li>Exported assets in multiple formats</li>
                    <li>Print-ready files (CMYK, 300 DPI, with bleed)</li>
                    <li>Web-ready files (RGB, optimized for screen)</li>
                    <li>Editable templates for future use</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>

                <h3>Challenge: Standing Out Without Stereotypes</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Problem:</strong> Mexican restaurant branding often falls into visual clichés that feel dated or inauthentic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Solution:</strong> Instead of literally depicting Mexican imagery, I extracted <em>principles</em> from traditional design—vibrant color, geometric patterns, handcrafted feel—and reinterpreted them through modern design language.
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Versatility Across Applications</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Problem:</strong> The logo needs to work on a tiny business card and a massive storefront sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Solution:</strong> Created multiple logo variations with different levels of detail. The icon-only version works at small sizes, while the full lockup shines at larger scales.
                </p>

                <h3>Challenge: Color Reproduction Across Media</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Problem:</strong> Colors look different on screen vs. print, and maintaining brand consistency is crucial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Solution:</strong> Defined specific color values for both RGB (screen) and CMYK (print) applications. Included color swatch files and Pantone references for professional printing.
                </p>

                <h2>Results & Reflections</h2>

                <p>
                    The Café Mexicali brand successfully bridges two culinary worlds with visual confidence and cultural respect. The identity is bold enough to catch attention in a crowded market, yet sophisticated enough to convey quality and care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project reinforced several important lessons:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research Pays Off:</strong> Understanding cultural context prevents superficial design</li>
                    <li><strong>Systems Over Single Solutions:</strong> A cohesive brand system is more valuable than a pretty logo</li>
                    <li><strong>Think in Applications:</strong> Design with real-world usage in mind from day one</li>
                    <li><strong>Details Matter:</strong> Small refinements—adjusted kerning, perfect color balance—elevate good work to great work</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <p>
                    Branding is storytelling through visual language. Every color choice, every curve in a letterform, every pattern repeat tells part of the story. Café Mexicali's story is one of fusion, vibrancy, and the joy of sharing great food with great people.
